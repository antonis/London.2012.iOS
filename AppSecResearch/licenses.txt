ATTRIBUTION -- a note reading "icons by Joseph Wain / glyphish.com" or similar, plus a link back to glyphish.com from your app's website, is the preferred form of attribution. Also acceptable would be, like, a link from within your iPhone application, or from the iTunes store page, but those aren't as useful to other people. If none of these work for you, please contact hello@glyphish.com and we can work something out.

USE WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION -- If attribution is not possible, workable or desirable for your application, contact hello@glyphish.com for commercial non-attributed licensing terms.
